# Introduction

Jinn is a a minimal, performant, AOT compliant, command line parser (and framework) for .NET.  
It's not a fork, but it's design and implementation is based on and inspired by 
the fantastic [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api).

Jinn is the opposite of a "batteries included" package, and you will need to implement 
some functionality yourself or use existing functionality from a NuGet package for thing like:

* Exception handling
* Parse error handling
* Help output
